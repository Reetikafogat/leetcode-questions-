MERGE STRINGS ALTERNATIVELY

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other,
append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

CODE:
class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        string=[]
        k=0
        j=0
        while k<len(word1):
            string.append(word1[k])
            while j<len(word2):
                string.append(word2[j])
                break
        return string
